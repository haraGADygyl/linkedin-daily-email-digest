Rossiter Bay
Rossiter Bay is on the southern coast of Western Australia, in the Cape Le Grand National Park east of Esperance. The bay is noted as the place that the explorer Edward John Eyre and his Aboriginal companion Wylie met the crew of the French whaling ship Mississippi in June 1841 after they had completed a crossing of the Nullarbor Plain.
